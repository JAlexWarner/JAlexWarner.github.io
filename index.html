            </div>  
            My name is James Warner and welcome to my personal website. 
            Professionally, I have worked as a Data Scientist and hopefully 
            will move into Full Stack Engineering.
            <br><br>
            I made this site to prepare for a job interview. It looked like
            it had potential so I chose to continue working on it.
            <br><br>
            This is a constant work in progress. I originally envisioned 
            working on this Hackathon style. Instead, I'll work on it iteratively
            based on daily peer feedback. So feel free to visit regularly
            and watch me become a Web Development Master.
            <br><br>
            The mobile version will take quite some refactoring so apologies 
            on that not being finished just yet. This is a day by day by process,
            so feel free to watch me learn responsive design on the desktop and
            mobile versions!
